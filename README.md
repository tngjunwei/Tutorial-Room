# Tutorial-Room
A personal project. Made use of simple data scraping with BeautifulSoup

Background: Sometimes, the library and the study corners are fully occupied. There are tutorial rooms upstairs that could be used. However, students don't know when lessons will be held in those rooms, and they don't want their study session to be disrupted. So, they gave up on using the tutorial rooms. 

About: This program automatically scrapes data from NTU class schedule site, allowing user to perform these 3 functions.

1) See when a tutorial room is available
2) See what class is held in a tutorial room at a certain time
3) Given an estimated study time, N hours, find the tutorial room that could be used

Future functionalities include:
1) list of lectures to be given at a lecture theatre (for enthusiastic students)
2) a friendly user-interface to view overall schedule for a tutorial room

3) Something new
